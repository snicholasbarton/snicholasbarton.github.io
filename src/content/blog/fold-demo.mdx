# Deep Dive: The Fold Component

This post demonstrates the **Fold** component functionality. It allows nesting content at multiple levels of depth, with a global controller to manage visibility.

## Level 1: Introduction

This is the top-level content. It is always visible (Depth 0).

<Fold>
  ### Level 1 Expanded

  You have expanded the first fold! This content is considered **Depth 1**.

  Inside here, we can go deeper.

  <Fold>
    #### Level 2: The Rabbit Hole

    Now we are at **Depth 2**. Things are getting more detailed here.

    *   This content is hidden by default if global setting is less than 2.
    *   It has a line on the left indicating nesting.

    <Fold>
       ##### Level 3: The Core

       Welcome to **Depth 3**. This is for the truly curious.

       You can collapse this specific section by clicking the left rail.
       Or collapse the parent (Level 2) to hide this too.

  Here is some more Level 1 content after the nested block.

## Another Top Level Section

<Fold>
  ### Level 1 (Part B)

  This is another fold at the root level.

  <Fold>
     #### Level 2 (Part B)

     Just checking that multiple independent folds work.
