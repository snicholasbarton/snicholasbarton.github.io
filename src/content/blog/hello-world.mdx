# Welcome to my MDX Blog

This is my first blog post written in **MDX**. MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Why MDX?

MDX is great because it combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React.

### Example Component

Here is a fully interactive React component rendered right here in the blog post:

<Counter />

### Code Snippet

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
